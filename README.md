**Tools and Technologies Used**

**Tkinter**: It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with tkinter is the fastest and easiest way to create the GUI applications.

**Random**: Python defines a set of functions that are used to generate or manipulate random numbers through the random module.

**PIL**: Python Imaging Library (expansion of PIL) is the de facto image processing package for Python language. It incorporates lightweight image processing tools that aids in editing, creating and saving images.
